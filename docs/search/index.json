Readers will get to view and experience the truth about Jerome\u0026rsquo;s killing and how this affects his parents and the community around him. Readers will also learn about a historical figure named Emmit Till and his life story of how he was killed.\nJerome was an ordinary boy who went to middle school with his sister. He was constantly bullied and picked on by three other boys named Eddie, Snap, and Mike. A new student names Carlos started coming to Jerome\u0026rsquo;s school. He and Jerome make friends. One day when school was over, and everyone was leaving the building, Carlos gave his toy gun to Jerome to play with. Later on, Jerome is shot and killed by a police officer. His spirit rises from himself. Jerome experiences and watches his court trial and makes an exciting relationship with Sarah, the daughter of the police officer who killed him now that this has happened. He also has the help of Emmet Till to realize what has happened and how historical racism could have led to his and other boys\u0026rsquo; killings.\nWhile I think Ghost Boys is a great book to read, and it can teach kids multiple lessons, I would recommend it for pre-teens ages 10+ and mature because of the sensitive topics, including racism, racial killings, violence, and more. I think this book would bring awareness to kids that things like this are happening worldwide. I also think kids would learn lessons about being more diverse and not judging a person based on their looks or where they\u0026rsquo;re from.\nI like the book Ghost Boys because of the lessons and story in this book. As I read this book, I learned that Emmit Till, Jerome, and others were killed due to their skin color. What happened to these boys in the story can connect to the killing of George Floyd in 2020, which was also racially motivated. As mentioned, this book helped me better understand what is happening today. It also helped me raise awareness of addressing discriminative situations.\n","date":"2022-07-18","permalink":"http://www.xanne3d.xyz/post/book-review-ghost-boys/","tags":["Book Reviews"],"title":"Book Review: Ghost Boys"},{"content":"Here is my opinon on whether it can be a good idea for high school students to have a part-time job.\nI think a part-time job can be beneficial for high school students to have a part-time job depending on the student. For example, if a high school student has difficulty finishing their work on time or in general, it might be harder for them to complete their high school work and have a part-time job simultaneously. But if a student can complete their work without any problem, it should be easier for them to have a part-time job.\nRegardless of what type of high school student should get a job, I think it could be an excellent idea for a high school student to get a job because of the many skills they will learn and gain. Getting a part-time job as a high school student can be beneficial because students learn real-life skills, including people skills (dealing with customers), teamwork, management, etc. All these skills can and will be helpful in future jobs when working in teams, leading a project, or more.\nAnother benefit that a part-time job can bring is the sense of working to earn money. A part-time job means you will make money by working hard for it. High school students can learn money management skills like saving money for future events like saving up money for university or college courses. They can also learn to spend money when necessary and set a budget for themselves if they go shopping to get things.\nLastly, a part-time job can teach a student time management. Students must organize their high school and work life by creating a daily planner or schedule. This can be used to write your hours in school, how much time is needed for homework after school, and when your shift starts. This can also help you organize your days and event in the future.\nIn conclusion, I think that a high school student can benefit from a part-time job because of the many things they will gain and earn, including life skills, money management skills, and time management skills.\n","date":"2022-07-18","permalink":"http://www.xanne3d.xyz/post/highschool-partime-jobs/","tags":["writing"],"title":"Can part-time jobs be beneficial for high school students?"},{"content":"Hi.
